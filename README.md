WINDOWS 11 MOBILE on LUMIA 950XL ( W10M CUSTOM ROM ) | test 1/2

If Youtuber "Fadil Fadz" sees this, I would like to take the way to install custom rom for everyone on your xdaforum because I don't have much time to guide everyone on how to install custom rom on lumia. Thanks

Hello, I am hamxim, I am a lumia rom custom person. Today I will announce to everyone a project that has been in progress for 1 month, which is the lumia 950xl rom windows 11 mobile (w10mobile) project. Currently it has test version 2. When the project reaches test 4, I will share it with everyone from test 1 to the latest test.
