WINDOWS 11 MOBILE on LUMIA 950XL ( W10M CUSTOM ROM ) | test 1/2
# If Youtuber "Fadil Fadz" sees this, I would like to take the way to install custom rom for everyone on your xdaforum because I don't have much time to guide everyone on how to install custom rom on lumia. Thanks
Hello, I am hamxim, I am a lumia rom custom person. Today I will announce to everyone a project that has been in progress for 1 month, which is the lumia 950xl rom windows 11 mobile (w10mobile) project. Currently it has test version 2. When the project reaches test 4, I will share it with everyone from test 1 to the latest test.
# Pros:
- Built-in updated apps like (Paint 3D, myTube, 8 Zip...etc)..
- Built-in CMD (Real CMD)
- You can run (.bat) files
- Updated original apps like (Video, Photos, Camera..etc)
- I feel it lighter (maybe because I like it)
- Unlocked by default
- Boot menu contains developer options
- File Explorer is updated and more advanced (you can access to the packages directly from it)
- Display Scale option (You can control the display scale from the control panel)
- Nice organize for Start menu (the way that Fadil organize the menu will give you an idea to build nice structure for the apps)
- You can install advanced apps using CMD like (Powershell, XAP installer, DotNet Console..etc)
- Nice icons for the default apps
# Cons & Tips:
- So far I didn't find anything bad
- Some icons will appear smaller than before because of the default display scale 100% (for me it's was more than normal), but you can change it form the control panel
- InteropTools is Beta (there is Legacy version so I prefer to replace it)
- You have to be patience with edgeTile if you want to use it , it's too slow when loading for no reason
- CMD with external keyboard is better for some functions and easier to use (use left arrow to remove).
